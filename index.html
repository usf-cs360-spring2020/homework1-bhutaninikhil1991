          Air Traffic Passenger Statistics
        </h1>

        <p>
          This example visualizes the Air Traffic Passenger Statistics dataset from DataSF(<a href="https://datasf.org/opendata/">https://datasf.org/opendata/</a>).
        </p>
        <h2 id="data">Data</h2>
        <p>          
          San Francisco International Airport Report on Monthly Passenger Traffic Statistics by Airline. Airport data is seasonal in nature, therefore any comparative analyses should be done on a period-over-period basis (i.e. January 2010 vs. January 2009) as opposed to period-to-period (i.e. January 2010 vs. February 2010). 
          It is also important to note that fact and attribute field relationships are not always 1-to-1. For example, Passenger Counts belonging to United Airlines will appear in multiple attribute fields and are additive, which provides flexibility for the user to derive categorical passenger counts as desired.
        </p>
        <p>The original dataset includes over 21.k rows as of December 2019. The original dataset includes 12 columns. 
          Most of these columns are categorical text, such as the operating airline and geographic region. 
          The activity period is encoded as a number but may be wrangled to be interpreted as a date. The only other number is passenger count.
          The direct link to data set is: <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Air-Traffic-Passenger-Statistics/rkru-6vcg">https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Air-Traffic-Passenger-Statistics/rkru-6vcg</a>

        <p>The dataset has following columns:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Activity Period:</strong> The year and month at which passenger activity took place. The column is encoded as a number but may be wrangled to be interpreted as a date. This column consist of data from July 2005 to September 2019. 
            The Activity Period is always displayed as six digits, with the four-digit year preceding a two-digit month. For example, 201001 is January 2010, 201002 is February 2010 and so on.</li>

          <li><strong>Operating Airline:</strong> Airline name for the operator of aircraft with passenger activity. The operating airline is encoded as text.</li>

          <li><strong>Operating Airline IATA Code:</strong> The International Air Transport Association (IATA) two-letter designation for the Operating Airline. The operating airline iata code is encoded as text.</li>

          <li><strong>Published Airline:</strong> Airline name that issues the ticket and books revenue for passenger activity. The published airline is encoded as text. A Published Airline may be the Operating Airline or it may have one or more Operating Airlines associated with it. 
            For example, United Airlines issues tickets and books revenue for Operating Airlines United Airlines and its regional affiliate Skywest Airlines. Therefore, Operating Airlines are a subset of Published Airlines.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Published Airline IATA Code:</strong>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) two-letter designation for the Published Airline. The published airline iata code is encoded as text.</li>
          
          <li><strong>GEO Summary:</strong> Designates whether the passenger activity in relation to SFO arrived from or departed to a location within the United States (“domestic”), or outside the United States (“international”) without stops. 
            The geo summary is encoded as text. The possible values for this column are Domestic, International.</li>
          
          <li><strong>GEO Region:</strong> Provides a more detailed breakdown of the GEO Summary field to designate the region in the world where activity in relation to SFO arrived from or departed to without stops. The geo region is encoded as text. 
            The possible values for this column are US, Africa, Asia, Australia/Oceania, Canada, Caribbean, Central America, Europe, Mexico, Middle East, South America.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Activity Type Code:</strong> A description of the physical action a passenger took in relation to a flight, which includes boarding a flight (“enplanements”), getting off a flight (“deplanements”) and transiting to another location (“intransit”). 
            The activity type code is encoded as text. The list of possible values are Enplaned, Deplaned, Thru/Transit. 
            The count of enplaned passengers is widely used in the aviation industry as a proxy for period-over-period comparative analyses of passenger trends. A passenger is categorized as Thru/Transit only if he or she connects through the airport to get to another location on the same aircraft and flight number. 
            Otherwise the connecting passenger would be counted as one deplanement and one enplanement. 
            It is SFO’s convention to count Thru/Transit passengers twice in total airport passenger counts, as if they had deplaned and then enplaned. Therefore, total airport passengers are calculated as Enplaned + Deplaned + Thru/Transit*2. </li>
          
          <li><strong>Price Category Code:</strong> A categorization of whether a Published Airline is a low-cost carrier or not a low-cost carrier. The price category code is encoded as text. The list of possible values are Low Fare, Other. 
            Since there is no objective criterion that segregates low-cost carriers from non low-cost carriers, an airline is tagged as Low Fare based on general industry acceptance</li>
          
          <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> The airport terminal designations at SFO where passenger activity took place. The terminal is encoded as text. The list of possible values are Terminal 1, Terminal 2, Terminal 3, International Terminal.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Boarding Area:</strong> The airport boarding area designations at SFO where passenger activity took place The boarding area is encoded as text. The list of possible values are A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Boarding Areas are a subset of Terminals. Terminal 1 contains Boarding Areas B and C. Terminal 2 contains Boarding Area D. 
            Terminal 3 contains Boarding Areas E and F. International Terminal contains Boarding Areas A and G.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Passenger Count:</strong> The number of monthly passengers associated with the above attribute fields. The passenger count is encoded as number. Passenger counts are additive for all attribute fields.</li>
         
        </ol>

        <p>This will of course differ depending on the assignment and data.</p>

        <h3 id="wrangling">Wrangling</h3>

        <p>The activity period is encoded as a number but is wrangled to be interpreted as a date in both Tableau and D3 V5.

              <h4>Interpretation</h4>

              <p>The GEO Summary is color encoded i.e blue color corresponds to "Domestic" and orange color corresponds to "International". 
                The Y axis corresponds to passenger count in Millions whereas X axis corresponds to months in Year 2019(which is till Sep 2019 because data is available till Sep 2019). The passenger count is encoded by the length of the bar, so longer bars represent higher passenger count.</p>

              <h4>Data Wrangling</h4>

              <p>
                Filtered the data by activity period as "greater than Dec 2018" and grouped the data by activity period(in Months), Geographical Summary(Domestic and International) and aggregating(sum) it by passenger count
                <pre>
                  Filtering By:    Activity Period > Dec 2018
                  Grouping By:     1. Activity Periods(in Months)
                                   2. Geographical Summary(Domestic and International)

              </p>

              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p>The below observations can be drawn from the visualization:<ul>
                  <li>Passenger count for Year 2019 is highest in month of August as compared to other months for "Domestic".</li>
                  <li>Passenger count for Year 2019 is highest in month of July as compared to other months for "International".</li>

              <h4>Interpretation</h4>

              <p>A heat map uses a matrix layout with colour and shading to show the relationship between two categories of values. The values are presented along each axis and the corresponding cell is then colour-coded to represent the relationship between the two categories. This heatmap shows the passenger count in different geographical regions (y axis) for different years (x axis). The darker cells would indicate there are more number of passengers in that particular region for a certain year. The general hierarchy of color shades varies from the darkest (highest values) through the mid range shades and to the light shades (lowest values).</p>

              <p>The below observations can be drawn from the visualization:<ul>
                  <li>Particularly for US, there is a signifcant increase in passenger count since 2005 till 2018 and there is slight decrease in passenger count in 2019.</li>
                  <li>However for rest of the regions, there is an insignificant increase in passenger count since 2005 till 2019</li>

              <h4>Interpretation</h4>

              <p>This visualization has multiple pie charts and each pie chart corresponds to a GEO Summary i.e. Domestic or International. Each month for Year 2019 is color coded. When you interpret one pie chart, look for differences in the size of the slices. The size of a slice shows the percentage of total passenger count corresponding to a particular month.</p>
